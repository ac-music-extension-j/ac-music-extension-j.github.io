<h3>
  Animal Crossing Music
  <small class="text-muted">(J variant)</small>
</h3>

<p class="lead">
Play Animal Crossing's background music in real-time throughout your day!
</p>

**Animal Crossing Music** is an unofficial, non-profit, [open-source](https://github.com/animal-crossing-music-extension/ac-music-extension), and most importantly, *fun* browser extension that allows you to play music from the Animal Crossing series in your browser while you browse the web! It makes use of Nintendo's resources [under fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use).

[The J variant](https://github.com/ac-music-extension-j/ac-music-extension-j) was made after over 3 years of no upstream maintenance, and a strong love for Animal Crossing.
